    "A paper by Fuhrer, et al (1995) studies the accuracy and efficiency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator versus the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator in the context of a simple linear-quadratic inventory model. They find that ML has some very nice properties over GMM in small samples when the model is simple. In the spirit of the Fuhrer, et al (1995) paper, we list the strengths and weaknesses of MLE vs. GMM more generally. I recommend you read the introduction to Fuhrer, et al (1995)."

    "1.1. MLE 강점\n",
    "\n",
    "More statistical significance. In general, MLE provides more statistical significance for parameter estimates than does GMM. This comes from the strong distributional assumptions that are necessary for the ML estimates.\n",
    "ML estimates are less sensitive to parameter or model normalizations than are GMM estimates.\n",
    "ML estimates have nice small sample properties. ML estimates have less bias and more efficiency with small data samples than GMM estimates in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2. MLE 약점\n",
    "\n",
    "MLE requires strong distributional assumptions. For MLE, the data generating process (DGP) must be completely specified. This assumes a lot of knowledge about the DGP. This assumption is likely almost always wrong.\n",
    "MLE is very difficult in rational expectations models. This is because the consistency of beliefs induces a nonlinearity in the likelihood function that makes it difficult to find the global optimum.\n",
    "MLE is very difficult in nonlinear models. The likelihood function can become highly nonlinear in MLE even if the model is linear when the data are irregular. This difficulty is multiplied when the model itself is more complicated and nonlinear."

    "\n",
    "GMM allows for most flexible identification. GMM estimates can be identified by any set of moments from the data as long as you have at least as many moments as you have parameters to estimate and that those moments are independent enough to identify the parameters. (And the parameters are independent enough of each other to be separately identified.)\n",
    "Good large sample properties. The GMM estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. GMM will likely be the best estimator if you have a lot of data.\n",
    "GMM requires minimal assumptions about the DGP. In GMM, you need not specify the distributions of the error terms in your model of the DGP. This is often a strength, given that most error are not observed and most models are gross approximations of the true DGP.\n",

    "1.4. GMM 약점\n",
    "\n",
    "GMM estimates are usually less statistically significant than ML estimates. This comes from the minimal distributional assumptions. GMM parameter estimates usually are measured with more error.\n",

    "1.5. Key questions to answer when deciding between MLE and GMM\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much data is available for the estimation? Large data samples will make GMM relatively more attractive than MLE because of the nice large sample properties of GMM and fewer required assumptions on the model\n",
    "- How complex is the model? Linear models or quadratic models are much easier to do using MLE than are more highly nonlinear models. Rational expectations models (macroeconomics) create an even more difficult level of nonlinearity that pushes you toward GMM estimation.\n",
    "- How comfortable are you making strong distributional assumptions? MLE requires a complete specification of all distributional assumptions of the model DGP. If you think these assumptions are too strong, you should use GMM."

    "GMM was first formalized by Hansen (1982). A strength of GMM estimation is that the econometrician can remain completely agnostic as to the distribution of the random variables in the DGP. For identification, the econometrician simply needs at least as many moment conditions from the data as he has parameters to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A moment of the data is broadly defined as any statistic that summarizes the data to some degree. A data moment could be as narrow as an individual observation from the data or as broad as the sample average. GMM estimates the parameters of a model or data generating process to make the model moments as close as possible to the corresponding data moments. See Davidson and MacKinnon (2004, ch. 9) for a more detailed treatment of GMM. The estimation methods of linear least squares, nonlinear least squares, generalized least squares, and instrumental variables estimation are all specific cases of the more general GMM estimation method."

    "Let $m(x)$ be an $R \\times 1$ vector of moments from the real world data $x$. And let $x$ be an $N \\times K$ matrix of data with $K$ columns representing $K$ variables and $N$ observations. Let the model DGP be characterized as $F(x,\\theta)$, where $F$ is a vector of equations, each of which is a function of the data $x$ and the $K \\times 1$ parameter vector $\\theta$. Then define $m(x|\\theta)$ as a vector of $R$ moments from the model that correspond to the real-world moment vector $m(x)$. Note that GMM requires both real world data $x$ and deterministic moments from the model $m(x|\\theta)$ in order to estimate $\\hat\\theta_{GMM}$. There is also a stochastic way to generate moments from the model, which we discuss later in our section on Simulated Method of Moments (SMM)."
